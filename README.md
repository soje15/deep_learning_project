# deep_learning_project
Classification project to classify species of fish in videos.

- We cannot upload all results on colab, due to using video of fish from the DTU HPC. 
The dataset is therefore too large to be practical to show on colab. 

Some results for proof of concept has been uploaded to colab, analyzing the IMDB dataset. As
the data in this project was too unstructured and low quality to get any meaningful results.
